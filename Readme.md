## <span style="color:#FF10F0"> Description </span>

In this task, we have created a chat-based app that allows users to chat with each other in real-time. The communication is set up using socket.io. A user should be able to create a new room. The created rooms are displayed in a list that users can click on to join the desired room. Once inside a room, the users are allowed to chat with each other.

## <span style="color:#FF10F0"> Setup Project </span>

This codebase is divided into [client](./client/) and [server](./server/).

Switch between folders by, for example, using the command - `cd server` to step into server.

Use these scripts to get started:

- `npm install` - Installs all necessary modules (run once).
- `npm run dev` - Starting development environment.
